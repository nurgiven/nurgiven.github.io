            <p><strong>What is the "Angels & Demons" about?</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;Angels & Demons is a 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and
                published by Pocket Books and then by Corgi Books. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon,
                who recurs as the protagonist of Brown's subsequent novels. Angels & Demons shares many stylistic
                literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies of secret societies, a single-day time frame,
                and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, architecture, and symbology are also heavily referenced
                throughout the book. A film adaptation was released on May 15, 2009.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The book contains several ambigrams created by real-life typographer John Langdon. Besides, the "Angels
                & Demons" and "Illuminati" designs, the title of the book is also presented as an ambigram on the
                hardcover book jacket (see illustration at right on this page), and on the inside cover of the paperback
                versions. The book also contains ambigrams of the words Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, which has served to
                bring the art of ambigrams to public attention by virtue of the popularity of the book. The
                "Illuminati Diamond" mentioned in the book is an ambigram of the four elements that are arranged in the
                shape of a diamond.</p>
