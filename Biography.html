        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;Daniel Gerhard Brown, (born June 22, 1964, Exeter, New Hampshire, U.S.), American author who
            wrote well-researched novels that centred on secret organizations and had
            intricate plots. He was best known for the Robert Langdon series, which notably
            included The Da Vinci Code (2003).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Brown attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a prep school where his father was a math
            teacher, and in 1986 he graduated from Amherst (Massachusetts) College. He then
            moved to California to pursue a career as a songwriter. Although he had little
            success in the music industry, in 1990 he wrote his first book, 187 Men to
            Avoid, a dating survival guide for women; it was published in 1995.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;In 1993 Brown joined the faculty at Exeter as an English and creative-writing
            teacher. Several years later the U.S.
            Secret Service visited the school to interview a student who had written an
            e-mail in which he joked about killing the president.
            The incident sparked Brown's interest in covert intelligence agencies, which
            formed the basis of his first novel, Digital Fortress (1998).
            Centred on clandestine organizations and code breaking, the novel became a model
            for Brown's later works. In his next novel, Angels & Demons (2000), Brown
            introduced Robert Langdon,
            a Harvard professor of symbology. The fast-paced thriller follows Langdon's
            attempts to protect the Vatican from the Illuminati, a secret society formed
            during the Renaissance that opposed the Roman Catholic Church.
            Although the novel received positive reviews, it failed to catch on with
            readers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;After his third novel, Deception Point (2001), Brown returned to Langdon with The
            Da Vinci Code, a thriller that centres on art history, Christianity's origins,
            and arcane theories. Attempting to solve the murder of the Louvre's curator,
            Langdon encounters mysterious organizations (Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion),
            discusses the hidden messages in Leonardo da Vinci's art, raises the possibility
            that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and fathered a child, and discovers the Holy
            Grail. The Da Vinci Code proved controversial, and many theologians and art
            scholars dismissed Brown's notions. The novel, however, proved immensely popular
            with readers. By 2009 more than 80 million copies had been sold, and editions
            were available in some 40 languages. Intense interest in the novel resulted in a
            spate of Code-related books and sparked sales of Brown's earlier works; in 2004
            all four of his novels appeared simultaneously on The New York Times best-seller
            lists. The film adaptations of The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were
            released in 2006 and 2009, respectively, with Tom Hanks starring as Langdon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Brown continued the adventures of his tweedy protagonist in The Lost Symbol
            (2009; TV series 2021), which centres on Freemasons, and Inferno (2013), which
            saw Langdon following clues related to Dante's poem The Divine Comedy in an
            effort to stop the release of a plague. The latter book was also adapted for the
            big screen, in 2016, with Hanks again portraying Langdon. Brown's fifth
            installment in the series, Origin, was released the following year.</p>
