            <p><strong>Who is Dan Brown?</strong></p>
            <p><em> &nbsp;Daniel Gerhard Brown</em> (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller
                novels, including the Robert Langdon novels <strong>Angels & Demons (2000)</strong>, <strong>The Da Vinci Code
                (2003)</strong>,<strong> The Lost Symbol (2009)</strong>, <strong>Inferno (2013)</strong>, and <strong>Origin (2017)</strong>. His
                novels are treasure hunts which usually take place over a period of 24 hours. They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and
                conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages and, as of 2012, have sold
                over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Inferno, have been
                adapted into films.</p>
            <br>
            <p>&nbsp;Brown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child,
                where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages
                in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles,
                and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays.
                On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree,
                but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts.
                Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Sauniere in The Da Vinci Code,
                and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown's subsequent
                novels. Angels & Demons shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies
                of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, architecture, and
                symbology are also heavily referenced throughout the book.</p>
