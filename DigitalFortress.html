            <p><strong>What is the "Digital Fortress" about?</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;Chillingly current and filled with more intelligence secrets than Tom Clancy, Digital Fortress transports
                the reader deep within the most powerful intelligence organization on earth-the National Security Agency
                (NSA)-an ultra-secret, multi-billion dollar agency that (until now) less than three percent of Americans
                knew existed. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;When the NSA's most classified technological wonder-an invincible code-breaking machine-encounters a
                mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls in its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant
                and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;The NSA is being held hostage... not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if
                released it will cripple U.S. intelligence.
                Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she
                believes in. Betrayed on all sides she finds herself fighting not only for her country, but for her
                life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;With a startling twist that leaves the agency scrambling to avert the biggest intelligence disaster in
                U.S. history, Digital Fortress never lets up. From the underground hallways of power, to the skyscrapers
                of Tokyo, to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;It is a battle for survival - a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius... an
                impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the balance of power. Forever.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown's subsequent
                novels. Angels & Demons shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies
                of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, architecture,
                and symbology are also heavily referenced throughout the book.</p>
